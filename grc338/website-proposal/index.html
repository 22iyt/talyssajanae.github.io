            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Soy and Wick</p>

            <p>Soy and Wick is a local soy candle shop that’s mission is to use natural, locally grown ingredients to curate eco-friendly candles to fill any space with an aroma that gives people a slice of Slome.</p>

            <h2>Target audience</h2>

            <p>
                Soy and Wick candles can be for anyone, but mainly focused on those with a refined and mature sense of smell to fully appreciate all layers of notes delicately curated into each candle. Our candles can fit into any lifestyle
                with a wide range of scents that each person can enjoy. We are also focused on using ingredients that are natural and won’t be irritating to those who encounter its scent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary goal is to truly make a quality candle. A single candle that can alter the mood of a room in an instant, a candle that can sooth and relax those who are accustomed to the stresses of life, all while assuring our
                customers that they have purchased a candle that is good for the senses, soul, and environment.
